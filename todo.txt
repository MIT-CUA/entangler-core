- Design RTIO interface (write example code)
- Design / simulate time difference gating
- Build RTIO interface
- Integrate
- Test:
    - Does the core time-out correctly if only master or slave running
    - Do the master and slave cores agree on the number of cycles
    - Do the cores exit correctly if the herald occurs
    - Does the pulse sequence look sensible on a scope


Problems:
The pulsed laser jitter is larger than the fibre delay line, hence we need to gate based on the time difference between the pulse input and the APD
We need to exit the core based on number of clock cycles, rather than number of loops, in case the partner is not ready
